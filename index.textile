h1. Motivation

* Travelled to Kathmandu, Nepal in 2007
* No electricity for 20 hours each day
* While the hotel had electricity through a generator much of the city was in darkness
* No Internet access as phone lines were down.
* As an Internet addict I suffered, could not imagine working competitively in Nepal
* Was asked to help build a basic website for the Women Skill Development Multi Cooperative
* This project failed due to inability to use a popular e-commerce solution

h1. The Problem 
* How modern e-commerce solutions can operate in developing countries 
* How can this technology be adapted for use by non-skilled users within rural environments.  

h1. My Aim

* Examine the current barriers facing non-profit organisations in the developing world.
* Investigate how non-profits currently approach the E-Commerce problem
* Create a prototype solution allowing any organisation in the developing world to operate on the Internet


h1. Barriers to E-Commerce

I broke this down into a number of catagories
* Government Policies
* Internet Access
* Language
* Payment Gateways
* Logistics

h1. Government Policies
* In 2010, Nepal entered a sixteen hours daily load shedding schedule. 
* This has been the norm for well over a decade.
* Currently 4 -- 8  hours of electricity every day -- the availability of power does not fit within business hours
* Generators and solar panels in wide use throughout Nepal

h1. Internet Access
* Internet penetration in Nepal reaches 1.7% of the entire population. (Internet Stats Nepal. In Internet World Stats, 2010) 
* Slow Internet penetration in any country combined with the lack of a constant electricity supply will always result in a low rural Internet usage. (Claire, 2006)
* Dial-up only Internet speeds available for many developing countries.

h1. Language
* Across the world more than 860 million men and women cannot read or write, it is estimated that 1 out of every 4 people are illiterate in the developing world.(UNESCO, 2002)
* From the case study I undertook I discovered that almost 50 percent of the organisation is illiterate. 
* The dominant language is Nepali
* Could not find any modern open source E-commerce system which supports this language


h1. Payment Gateways

* 85 percent of the worlds on-line population has used the Internet to make a purchase
* 60% of global on-line consumers used their credit card for a recent on-line purchase, while one in four on line consumers chose Paypal. (Trends in Online Shopping. In The Nielsen Company, 2008)

How does cash get from the customer to the organisation?

* Gateways are mainly US focused requiring a US bank account.  
* Transaction fees are preferable to high monthly fees for smaller transaction rates.
* The choice of a payment gateway package will be very important for each NGO as policies within these payment gateways may impact the NGOs business and possibly impact any funds transferred.

h1. Logistics
* Nepal has access to UPS and Fedex in large cities and the national postal service in all cities
* Rapid growth of e-commerce in the US can be attributed to infrastructure already in place and an easy availability of a physical delivery system. Such systems are very rare in developing countries (Hawk, 2004)
* Some developing countries still lack proper postal services, difficulties can arise in the delivery of products due to a lack of actual street addresses.(Kshetri, 2007)

h1. Prototype Requirements
* Allow off-line access to orders, customers and products
* Simple User Interface
* Multi-Cultural Interface (Nepali and English)
* Initial Prototype to allow Paypal and Authorise.Net
* Maintain PCI requirements
* Robust synchronisation from local database to master server and vice versa
	

h1. Offline access
* Desktop native application vs Browser only application	
* Low bandwidth environment, application size must be small.
* No download of 3rd party application (difficult to maintain)
* Ruled out separate database + Java Virtual Machine
* Too difficult for non-technical user to install any application

h1. Enter HTML5
* W3C Candidate Recommendation stage expected to be complete in 2012
* Future of the Internet
* Allows for offline database support
* Database stored within Web Browser
* Simpler end user experience, no need for bulky application
* Everything in the browser


h1. Data Synchronisation
* Speed is the key. Synchronizing must be complete in seconds, that may be all a user is on the internet for.
* Utilize HTTP Socket Interfaces
* Pass messages in JSON (JavaScript Object Notation), a lightweight data-interchange format

h2. Node.JS
* "Node.js":http://www.nodejs.org is an evented I/O framework built on top of Google's V8 JavaScript engine.
* Maintain a Node.js server to accept queries from the browser and return results to the browser

Javascript is universally supported and extremely fast

h1. Testing the prototype
How do we know that it's working?

* Test, Test, then test some more
* Write a test before any code is written
* Use "RSpec":http://rspec.info-- RSpec is a Behaviour Driven Development framework for writing executable code examples.
* Use "Cucumber":http://www.cukes.info -- Cucumber is a tool that can execute plain-text functional descriptions as automated tests. 
* Use "Integrity":http://www.integrityapp.com -- A Continuous Integration Testing Server -- Pull from Source Control ("GIT":http://www.github.com), test, send error logs to developer automatically 



h1. Everything shall live in the cloud:

* Horizontally scale servers on "Slicehost Virtual Servers":http://www.slicehost.org
* Amazon Cloudfront for faster content delivery around the world
* Amazon Simple Storage Service (Amazon S3) for storing all assets
* MongoDB as the scalable, high-performance, schema-free, document-oriented database
* Everything hosted on Ruby on Rails for rapid development

p=. The non-profit organisation is oblivious to all of this!


h1. Summary 
* HTML5 is going to change the web as we see it
* Node JS is very exciting stuff, with lots of potential. 
* Sending payments from the customer to the non-profit organisation is the biggest challenge
* Utilise open source applications everywhere
* Taking advantage of the cloud to scale service rapidly if needed
* Staff in non-profits are not technical whatsoever, adapting my language and approach to gathering information has been huge challenge.



h1. Where to Next
* Further understanding end-user perspectives and their view of social realities when operating a business on-line from the third world
* Finalise Database Design
* Designing and developing user interface
* Create and maintain all rspec / cucumber cases
* Bringing everything together, application, payment gateways, logistics, cloud
* Aid in the creation of first e-commerce shop,  Women Skill Development Multi Cooperative have requested the very first one.
* Generating 1st official ransaction
* Success, hopefully!
